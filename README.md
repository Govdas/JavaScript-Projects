# JavaScript-Projects

These are some small projects I made using JavaScript.


- ### [Calculator](/Calculator)
A basic 4 function calculator.

- ### [Pizza Menu](/Pizza_Project)
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings.  
It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

- ### [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](/TicTacToe)
A classic tic-tac-toe game.
